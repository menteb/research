# Research

**Academic tool for doing research the Way of the Nerd.**

The idea for this project is derived from the work process Conner McDaniel shared on his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO4T8JDNYG0) back in 2017. He also has some code snippets on his [GitHub page](https://github.com/connermcd).

### Some features

- Import academic articles and books into a directory structure
- The DOI from articles will automatically be extracted, or when this is not possible, you will be prompted for either a DOI number or manual entry of all data.
- The imported items will be added to a global BibTeX file
- Every item gets a Markdown file preformatted for note taking in your favourite editor
- Every Markdown file will include the BibTeX entry for the item, and the citation in one of five styles: APA, Chicago, Harvard, MLA, and Vancouver.
- **Tags** and **Keywords** can be added to each item, resulting in a handy retrieval mechanism to search for items in your repository.
- You can easily open a research item for note taking using command completion, and search for existing items.
- Notes can easily be exported as individual PDF files, or one PDF file including every note taken.
